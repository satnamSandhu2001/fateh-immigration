              Every year, thousands of students from all over the world travel
              to Canada to further their education. If you want to join them,
              you'll need to apply for a student visa. There are several
              benefits to studying in Canada. The country is well-known for its
              high-quality education, with its institutions frequently ranking
              among the top in the world. Furthermore, Canada is a welcoming and
              diversified country with something for everyone. If you want to
              study in Canada, you'll need to apply for a study visa. Foreign
              nationals can study at designated learning institutes (DLIs) in
              Canada with a Canada study visa. Applicants must satisfy specific
              standards, including acceptance to a DLI, to be eligible for a
              study visa.â€‹

              A visitor visa, often known as a tourist visa, allows you to enter
              a foreign nation for a short period of time to spend your
              vacation, visit family or friends, or for any other
              non-work-related purpose. When your visiting visa expires, you may
              be forced to leave the country. If you have a valid passport,
              Fateh Education & Immigration Services will help you through the
              complete visiting visa procedure for Australia, Canada, the United
              Kingdom, the United States, and many more countries. A Visitor
              Visa will allow you to go to wonderful sites all around the world.
              This is the visa that you will all require for your vacation. You
              can visit your relatives or friends who live in other countries
              with a Visitor Visa and spend valuable time with them. Unlike
              other types of Visas, the processing period for a Visitor Visa is
              quite short, and it is normally issued within a few weeks. This
              allows you to properly organise your perfect vacation.

              Permanent Residence
            </h3>
            <p className="mt-4 text-black/50 font-medium leading-relaxed text-justify">
              Permanent residence is a person's legal resident status in a
              nation or territory where they are not a citizen but have the
              right to live permanently. This is normally for an indefinite
              amount of time; a person with such legal status is referred to as
              a permanent resident. In the United States, such a person is
              referred to as a green card holder but more formally as a Lawful
              Permanent Resident (LPR). <br />
              Permanent residency itself is distinct from right of abode, which
              waives immigration control for such persons. Persons having
              permanent residency still require immigration control if they do
              not have right of abode. However, a right of abode automatically
              provides someone permanent residency. This status also gives work
              permit in most cases. In many Western countries, the status of
              permanent resident grants the holder the right to abode despite
              the fact that the holder is not a citizen of the country.
